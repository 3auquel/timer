# Countdown Timer

A simple, customizable countdown timer built with JavaScript that displays the remaining time until a specified deadline.

## Features

- **Live countdown**: Hours, minutes, and seconds displayed in real-time.
- **Auto-stop**: Timer stops at zero and displays "00:00:00" when the deadline is reached.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the deadline date and target HTML elements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/countdown-timer.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd countdown-timer
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser:

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

   or simply double-click the file.

## Usage

1. Set your target date by updating the `deadline` variable in the script:

   ```javascript
   let deadline = '2024-10-09';
   ```

2. Ensure you have the following HTML structure to display the countdown:

   ```html
   <div id="timer">
      <span class="hours">00</span>:<span class="minutes">00</span>:<span class="seconds">00</span>
   </div>
   ```

3. Call the timer initialization function:

   ```javascript
   initializeTimer('timer', deadline);
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how the countdown timer will appear:

```html
<div id="timer">
   <span class="hours">10</span>:<span class="minutes">30</span>:<span class="seconds">45</span>
</div>
```

## Customization

You can easily change the styling of the timer by modifying the CSS file or adding your own styles. For example:

```css
#timer {
   font-size: 2em;
   color: #333;
   display: flex;
   justify-content: center;
   align-items: center;
}
```
